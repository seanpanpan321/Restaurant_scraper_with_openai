       "0  Reviews are generally positive with a rating of 4.6 out of 5, indicating high satisfaction among customers.  Customers generally enjoyed the food at Mitr Thai, with positive comments on the quality of dishes such as pad see ew, crab legs in curry sauce, shrimp with eggplant, pad Thai, and green curry chicken. The restaurant was praised for its ambience and attentive service, although some customers felt slightly rushed during their dining experience. One customer noted a preference for softer batter on the crab legs but still enjoyed the dish overall. Customers also mentioned a lychee martini on tap.   \"I can't speak to the dine-in experience, but need to give the food a 5* review!\"   "
